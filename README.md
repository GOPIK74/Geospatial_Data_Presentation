üöÄ Exploring Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and Satellite Data for Geospatial Projects üåç
Welcome to this repository! In 2024, satellite imagery and DEM data have become more accessible than ever, offering incredible potential for GIS and remote sensing projects. This repository focuses on exploring, analyzing, and processing different types of DEM data along with satellite imagery to extract meaningful insights.

üìÇ Project Structure
data/: Contains raw DEM data files from various sources like SRTM, ASTER, Copernicus, etc.
scripts/: Python scripts for DEM data processing, visualization, slope, and contour analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks showcasing step-by-step analysis of DEM and satellite data.
output/: Processed outputs including slope maps, elevation models, and water body analysis.
